Following my dissertation, this project formed the majority of my research-based work.

## Understanding Practice

I began my investigation of machine learning primarily as a software developer. Demand for AI programmers is pretty high. You're not really programming so much as you're setting up a machine to do the programming for you. Even the code for very complex, state of the art models is rarely longer than a few hundred lines.

I made various attempts to visualise the machine learning datasets I was looking at. Each one is different, requiring a different mode of presentation. I printed a spreadsheet containing anonymised data about American criminals at a large format. I had part of the FERET database reproduced as C-type prints and hung them in a grid to emphasise its scale and strictly controlled aesthetics. I 3d-rendered and animated part of the Gait dataset. The terms of use of these databases usually ban online reproduction  of any significant portion of them, which is the point of the project.

Eventually, the book emerged as a good medium. It would allow me to reproduce a larger share of the databases (which is still less than 5%). The book is also less overwhelming than the wall mounted grid. They're a familiar format that allows the reader to discover the scale of these databases slowly.

I decided to print the books myself on a laserjet and perfect-bind them by hand. I had a few reasons for this:

- Since I couldn't afford offset or risograph printing (and both would be silly to do for a tiny edition) digital print seemed like my only option. I didn't see how a commercial printer would produce significantly better results than I could, especially since the books are black and white. 
- Doing the printing myself meant there wasn't a print-deadline - I could print the books the night before handin if I had to. This gave me a few more weeks to work on the writing and editorial design.
- I could use my own paper. From what I've gathered, printers won't generally let you use named papers (i.e the stuff that's in the G.F. Smith sample book) unless you're ordering big runs. Getting technical about paper - comparing different weights, ordering samples, doing test prints, working out grain directions - was perhps the most enjoyable part of the project.
- It allowed me to make protoypes as I was designing the book. I could run test prints on different stocks and practice my binding technique knowing that what I was looking at would be very close to the final product. I first saw this way of working at [GTF](http://www.graphicthoughtfacility.com/) - of course, they have the budgets to order up test prints from a commercial printer.

The final outcome is a set of three books documenting and giving context around machine learning datasets.

All are printed on [Southbank Book White 115g](http://www.johnpurcell.net/sbank.html) (front matter), [Heritage Bookwhite 100g](http://www.johnpurcell.net/heriwoodCON.html) (body) and [Colorplan Pale Grey 270g](http://colorplanpapers.com/50colours) (Covers).

I think the Colorplan and Heritage papers are succesful in their applications. However, I don't think there's enough of a contrast (in weight, texture or colour) between the Southbank and Heritage stocks to make to create hierarchy. It's the equivalent of pairing Arial and Helvetica - it just creates visual noise.
