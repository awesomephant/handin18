Following my dissertation, this project formed the majority of my research-based work.

## Understanding Practice

I began my investigation of machine learning primarily as a software developer. Demand for AI programmers is pretty high. You're not really programming so much as you're setting up a machine to do the programming for you. Even the code for very complex, state of the art models is rarely longer than a few hundred lines.

## Adding Context

Generating outcomes for this project was difficult



### ML Books

I made various attempts to visualise the machine learning datasets I was looking at. Each one is different, requiring a different mode of presentation. I printed a spreadsheet containing anonymised data about American criminals at a large format. I had part of the FERET database reproduced as C-type prints and hung them in a grid to emphasise its scale and strictly controlled aesthetics. I 3d-rendered and animated part of the Gait dataset. The terms of use of these databases usually ban online reproduction  of any significant portion of them, which is the point of the project.
Eventually, the book emerged as a good medium. It would allow me to reproduce a larger share of the databases (which is still less than 5%). The book is also less overwhelming than the wall mounted grid. They're a familiar format that allows the reader to discover the scale of these databases slowly. 
The books were laser-printed on Southbank Book White 120g (for the introductions) and Heritage Book 100g (for the main body) and perfect-bound by hand. They come with a hastily written essay sketching put the cultural and political significance of the databases. [I have some thoughts on Indesign]()
