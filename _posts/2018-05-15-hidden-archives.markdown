This project started primarily as an excuse for me to learn about machine learning, which seemed like a smart career move. i had originally planned to use neural networks to generate imagery, but this turned out to be far more complex than I had imagined. This is one of the visual outcomes I was able to produce:

Images generated by Pixel-RNN (trained for 100 epochs on the FERET Database) 
</p>

At this point the project shifted from being process-based and focussd on outcomes (like the drawing machines) to being more research-driven. Instead of building machine learning models myself, I started to look at the datasets that are commonly used by researchers to train algorithms to do various tasks.

These databases aren't meant for humans to look at, even in terms of file formats. Nearly every dataset I looked at came in some compressed format, together with heaps of (to me) useless meta-data. I spent hours writing special one-off programs to read these files, extract the relevant data and save it into a format I could work with.

## Secondary Research

With tutoring from Sigune Hamann, I started to explore the political and social consequences of the archive. Significant readings include:
- Paglen, T. (2016), *[Invisible Images (Your Pictures Are Looking at You)](https://thenewinquiry.com/invisible-images-your-pictures-are-looking-at-you/)*
- Flusser, V. (1984), *[Towards A Philosophy Of Photography](https://archive.org/details/FlusserVilemTowardsAPhilosophyOfPhotography1984)*
- Starnes, S. (2017), *[TREVOR PAGLEN: A Study of Invisible Images](https://brooklynrail.org/2017/10/artseen/TREVOR-PAGLEN-A-Study-of-Invisible-Things)*
- Bridle, J. (2013), *[How Britain Exported Next-Generation Surveillance](https://medium.com/matter/how-britain-exported-next-generation-surveillance-d15b5801b79e)*
- Enwezor, O. (2008), *[Archive Fever: Photography between History and the Monument](http://moodle.arts.ac.uk/pluginfile.php?forcedownload=1&file=%2F%2F520513%2Fblock_quickmail%2Fattachment_log%2F172019%2Fenwezor-archive.pdf)*
- Foster, H. (2004), *[An Archival Impulse](http://moodle.arts.ac.uk/pluginfile.php?forcedownload=1&file=%2F%2F520513%2Fblock_quickmail%2Fattachment_log%2F172019%2FHal%20Foster_archival%20impulse.pdf)*
- Sekula, A, *[The Body and the Archive (1986)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/778312.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A53f6ebc3ba7c0f02e549d2dd321beee4)*

Allan Sekula's essay was especially important. In it, he describes how photographic archives have historically been used as "an instrument of social control an differentiation underwritten by dubious scientific principles". He talks about [Alphonse Bertillon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Bertillon), a French policeman who created a huge bullshit system to classify criminals based on their photographs of their faces.

Project like this, Sekula writes,

> constitute two methoological poles of the positivist attempts to define and regulate social deviance" The criminal (for Bertillon) and the racially inferior (for Galton) exist in the netherworld of the photographic archive, and when they do assume a prominent place in that archive, it is only to dissociate them, to insist on and illuminate their difference, their archival apartness from normal society

Segune also suggested I look at practitioners who use the archive in an artistic context, either re-contextualising and criticising existing archives or creating new work *in the form of an archive*

One of the earliest examples of this is *Evidence* (1977) by Larry Sultan and Mike Mandel. They collected photographs from the archives of NASA and compiled them into a book, stripping them of their original context.

Trevor Paglen is a photographer who's built a body of work centered around covert government operations. I think his photographs of spy satellites in the night sky, as well as his photographs of secret military bases (taken using astronomical telescopes) are particularly brilliant.

As I was reading the scientific papers that describe these databases, I became intrigued with the aesthetics of their illustratons. There's something terrifying about the way they reduce parts of the human experience (the body, speech, movements, relationships) into figures of maths equations. The fact that these papers typically appear in print journals and go through multiple layers of photocopying and scanning before they end up online adds another dimension to this.

## Outcomes

I made various attempts to visualise the machine learning datasets I was looking at. Each one is different, requiring a different mode of presentation.

Eventually, the book emerged as a good medium for a number of reasons: 

- It would allow me to reproduce a larger share of the databases (though that share is still small).
- It takes these databases out of their natural, digital context and make the accessible in a physical form. The way the books are designed (small format, traditional typography, off-white paper) supports this idea of creating a decidedly non-digital space.
- Finally, a printed outcome gets around the licensing agreements of many datasets which prohibit online reproduction.

I decided to print the books myself on a laserjet and perfect-bind them by hand. I had a few reasons for this:

- Since I couldn't afford offset or risograph printing (and both would be silly to do for a tiny edition) digital print seemed like my only option. I didn't see how a commercial printer would produce significantly better results than I could, especially since the books are black and white. 
- Doing the printing myself meant there wasn't a print-deadline - I could print the books the night before handin if I had to. This gave me a few more weeks to work on the writing and editorial design.
- I could use my own paper. From what I've gathered, printers won't generally let you use named papers (i.e the stuff that's in the G.F. Smith sample book) unless you're ordering big runs. Getting technical about paper - comparing different weights, ordering samples, doing test prints, working out grain directions - was perhps the most enjoyable part of the project.
- It allowed me to make protoypes as I was designing the book. I could run test prints on different stocks and practice my binding technique knowing that what I was looking at would be very close to the final product. I first saw this way of working at [GTF](http://www.graphicthoughtfacility.com/) - of course, they have the budgets to order up test prints from a commercial printer.

All are printed on [Southbank Book White 115g](http://www.johnpurcell.net/sbank.html) (front matter), [Heritage Bookwhite 100g](http://www.johnpurcell.net/heriwoodCON.html) (body) and [Colorplan Pale Grey 270g](http://colorplanpapers.com/50colours) (Covers).

As with the drawing machine project, i made an effort to take [contemporaneous notes](http://www.maxkoehler.com/2018/feret-database/)
