The goal of this project was twofold. On a technical level, it created an opportunity to explore physical computing (using the Arduino platform), interaction design and generative imagery. On a conceptual level, it allowed me to investigate human-machine relationships from a cultural perspective.

> Color Library is a database of color profiles for artists, designers, photographers, and printers who are looking for a novel yet professional color management solution. Color Library offers a large variety of color combinations, from basic colors to metallics, neons, and pastels. Color Library was created within the Workflow research and development project. It was launched in 2014 during a workshop held at ECAL/University of Art and Design Lausanne with Franz Sigg (RIT/Rochester Institute of Technology) and Maximage.
